## About the Project

Listd is an Android application that serves as a to-do list that lets you save your daily tasks. The application emphasizes on simplicity and ease of use. Whether you want a shopping list, grocery list or you just have lots of things to remember Listd is built for you.

Listd was created as a school project, in which I worked together with my brilliant classmate Najem Seddiqi. This project was done during my final year as a systems science student for a course about the design and development of mobile applications, which among other things, covered the development of Android applications.
